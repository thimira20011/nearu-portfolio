## üí° Project Overview

The primary objective of NearU is to solve the critical local community problem of fragmented and hard-to-find university-area services (e.g., food vendors, taxi services, cake makers). The platform provides a single, verified location for discovery and direct interaction, while incorporating robust safety and monetization features.

## ‚ú® Features

### For Users
- **Discovery & Search**: Browse businesses by category and location
- **Direct Interaction**: Contact functionality to place orders and make bookings
- **Social Proof**: Add detailed reviews and star ratings to services
- **Bulk Orders**: Unique feature allowing students to submit bulk inquiries to multiple verified contacts simultaneously

### For Businesses
- **Profile Management**: Comprehensive business registration, profile updates, and service listing management

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Access views, ratings, and sales overview
- **Monetization Management**: Control premium features and listing boosts

### Safety & Moderation
- **Admin Approval**: All new business registrations require admin approval before going live
- **Service Removal**: Admin can remove services with excessive negative reviews or poor ratings
- **Transparency**: Mandatory disclaimer banner stating platform limitations and responsibilities

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Architecture

### AWS Cloud Infrastructure

Our infrastructure leverages AWS services for high availability, scalability, and automation:

- **Compute**: Elastic Beanstalk (or EC2 + Docker) with Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Data & Storage**: Amazon RDS for database, Amazon S3 for file assets
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda for image processing and scheduled maintenance
- **Notifications**: Amazon SES and SNS for email and push/SMS notifications

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project follows Scrum Agile methodology with a professional CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Source**: Version controlled on GitHub
2. **Continuous Integration**: AWS CodeBuild runs xUnit/NUnit tests on every push
3. **Continuous Deployment**: AWS CodePipeline automatically deploys to Elastic Beanstalk
